# Job Application Tracker
Track and manage all the jobs youâ€™ve applied to in one place. This app helps you stay organized during your job hunt. Good luck!

## Overview
Job Application Tracker is a web application that allows users to:
- Add, update, and delete(TBD)  job applications.
- Track the status of applications (e.g., Applied, Interview, Offer, Rejected).
- View a dashboard of all job applications.

The app is built with a modern tech stack and deployed using CI/CD pipelines.

## Future Improvements

### Backend:
1. Add Authentication & Authorization for APIs
2. Use a better SQL server (e.g., MSSQL, Postgres)
3. Use Terraform for infrastructure as code (IaC)
4. Explore additional improvements as needed

### Frontend:
1. Get a better design for the entire app
2. Make it responsive (for both Desktop and Mobile)
